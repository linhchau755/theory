# Theory

A repository for theoretical concepts, algorithms, and implementations in computer science and mathematics.

## Overview

This repository serves as a collection of theoretical foundations, algorithms, and their practical implementations. It's designed for educational purposes, research reference, and personal knowledge consolidation.

## Features

- **Algorithm Implementations**: Clean, well-documented code for various algorithms
- **Mathematical Proofs**: Selected proofs for fundamental theorems
- **Performance Analysis**: Big-O notation and empirical performance measurements
- **Visualizations**: Where applicable, graphical representations of concepts

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/linhchau755/theory.git
cd theory
```

No additional dependencies are required for most content. Specific requirements (if any) will be noted in individual directories.

## Usage

Browse the repository structure:

```
theory/
├── algorithms/        # Algorithm implementations
├── proofs/            # Mathematical proofs
├── data-structures/   # Data structure implementations
└── papers/            # Summaries of important papers
```

Each concept is contained in its own directory with:
- Implementation code (where applicable)
- README with explanation
- Test cases (where applicable)
